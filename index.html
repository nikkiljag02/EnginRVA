          <p>Currently, my student is a school teacher, but her dream is to become a stewardess. Due to the war, the airlines were shut down, and she is unable to pursue her dream career. However, that doesn’t stop her from advancing in English in order to accomplish her goal one day. Every lesson, she not only inspires me with her growth and resilience but also teaches me new things.</p>

          <h4>Vice President</h4>
          <p>My student is a computer systems major at University, where she aspires to become a data scientist. However, the turbulence of war in her home country has prevented her access to the technology her university provides. My student continues to take the initiative to advance her professional career by taking English lessons to increase her proficiency.</p>

          <h4>Recruitment Lead</h4>
          <p>My student not only excels in sports and the arts but is also excited to pursue this journey in mastering the English language. I hope to not only be a teacher but also a support system during this difficult time. Helping her achieve her goals with the speaking skills ENGin and I can provide, I can’t wait to see where it takes her!</p>
